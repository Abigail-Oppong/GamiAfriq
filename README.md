# Most students who absent themselves in class usually ask their mates who present themselves to class to sign them in for attendance. 
This issue needs a critical attention as it indirectly shows how dishonestly students are. 
Ashesi is bound in creating African leaders who will be honest. 
Hence I intend to make a problem that will help students sign in online without signing on sheets.
